      Changed to visualize a batch a time instead of a random sample.
    Randomly choose a data to visualize instead of always choose the first one
    in the batch.

    After setting up validation brain, training brain would hold reference to
    tensors of validation brain. A deep copy needs to be implemented to copy
    layers of Brain but not copy tensor references(tensor reference would be
    updated when setup is called again).

    MNIST is suitable to be used as test data. The one layer convolution
    network trained before is a good candidate to use for testing.

      Should be local.
    Since the update could be any time as long as in the same iteration, the
    update should be put in the global context. For now, for agile coding, I
    put it in BN layer.

**** TODO But they do not share much, deal with computation graph and running sess
*** TODO make debug level switchable in kid
*** TODO add shape of conv filter in
*** TODO aggregate all tests as a suite, so having more control
*** TODO Think a better way to pass parameters instead of using dictionary, which is error prone.
*** TODO Think how to place PaddingLayer and Jokers into the right place
    Currently, PaddingLayer is Child of both ProcessingLayer and
    Joker. Essentially, it should be the child of certain general block.
*** TODO Add option and flag to tuner to continue training from checkpoint.
*** TODO Write a better test for layers.
*** TODO Handle the epoch completed exception of tensorflow, so if things go wrong, it would fail loudly.
*** TODO Remove summaries for the activations that obviously are not going to be sparse.
*** TODO Add a source providing fake data to do finer granularity test.
*** TODO Change MNIST sensor to use all training data as training.
*** TODO Visual a batch
    Visualize more than one sample a time.
*** TODO Check whether scalar parameter summary is right
*** TODO The interface of Source and Sensor should be reconsidered.
     1. Maybe Source and Sensor could be merged.
     2. They should have similar abstract property like data of Block.
*** TODO Change all system exit to exception raising.
*** TODO Parameter saving should be an iteration over layers of a brain
     instead of all the syntax sugar of tensorflow that saves all trainable
     variables.
     It also should be moved to brain instead of staying in Survivor.
