`akid` is a python package written for doing research in Neural Network. It
also aims to be production ready by taking care of concurrency and
communication in distributed computing. It supports [Tensorflow](tensorflow.org)
and [Pytorch](pytorch.org) as backends, including Tensorboard. If combining with
[GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[Kubernetes](kubernetes.io), it is able to provide dynamic and elastic
scheduling, auto fault recovery and scalability.

See http://akid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html for documentation.
